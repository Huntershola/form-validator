# Form Validation Project

This project provides a simple yet powerful example of front-end form validation using only HTML and JavaScript. It includes a registration form that validates user input on various fields including name, phone number, email, website URL, and password.

## Overview

The form features several fields that are essential for a typical sign-up process:

- **Full Name:** Validates that the user has entered a minimum of 3 characters.
- **Phone Number:** Ensures the phone number matches a specific pattern (e.g., 555-555-5555).
- **Email Address:** Validates that the email address entered is in the correct format.
- **Website URL:** Checks for a valid URL format.
- **Password and Confirm Password:** Enforces a strong password policy and checks that both passwords match. The policy requires at least 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character, and 1 number, with a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Features

- **Client-Side Validation:** Provides immediate feedback to users, improving the overall user experience by preventing form submissions with invalid data.
- **Regular Expression Patterns:** Utilizes regex for precise validation of phone numbers, emails, and password requirements.
- **Custom Error Messages:** Displays custom error messages that guide users to correct mistakes.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures that the form looks great on devices of various sizes.
